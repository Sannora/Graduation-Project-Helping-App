**Helping App Project ü§ù**

A helping app project that I've developed as a school assignment.

**Description**

Project aims to create a community of helping people while also granting opportunities to people to share their abilities with the world. Everyday basic needs of people would be satisfied free of charge while also creating a new firendly environment where people do their bests without any pressure of duty/responsibility.
The project, fort he time being, offers only 5 help interest categories which are namely; translation, academic, software, mechanics ‚Äì maintenance, craftsmanship. It can be increased in time and by demand later on but for a beta version it is decided to go with these predefined categories.

**NOTE: Unfortunately the project is not 100% functional for its user interfaces but the functionalities of the project are intact, here is a full review video of the project you can check out:
